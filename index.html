            As part of UCSD's CSE 125 Video Game course, we are to design and create a 3D multiplayer game from scratch in a team of 7 people. Our idea is to create a game that combines the complexity of a dungeon crawler with the chaotic interactions of a party game. Players will be able to compete against friends to win in various minigames, build traps, and race in the dungeon.
